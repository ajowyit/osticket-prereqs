- In Azure, create a VM with the same configurations as before and name it osTicket-vm. You can refer back to this previous project if needed:
[Creating Virtual Machines in the Cloud](https://github.com/joshuaheck1/VM-creation)

- [osTicket Installation Files](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1b3RBkXTLNGXbibeMuAynkfzdBC1NnqaD&export=download&authuser=0) 

<p>- Log in to the osTicket-vm, copy the osTicket Installation Files link above, and paste it into the browser. This will take you to the zip file containing what we need to install osTicket to the VM.</p>
<p>- Yes, it is a large file but click Download anyway.</p>
<p>- Don't "Open file" instead click the folder icon to open the file where it is. Downloads.</p>
 <br/>

<p>- From Downloads, drag the zip file to the deskstop.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>- Right-click the folder and select Extract All...</p>
<p>- Confirm the correct destination (Desktop) and click Extract. The folder should be called "osTicket-Installation-Files"</p>
<p>- Once the folder is finished extracting, you may have to minimize a window to see it. It should appear by the Browser icon on the Desktop.</p>
<p>- We will use the files in this folder to install osTicket. I moved the install folder to the top right of my screen (for easy locate) and moved the zip file to a bottom corner to ignore for the rest of the lab. This was to prevent mixing them up because its about to get saucy. üòè (You can move the zip file to the recycle bin. I didn't realize that til later in the lab.)</p>

<p>- Now we're going to enable IIS (Internet Information Services) within Windows and ensure CGI is installed as well.</p>
<p>- From the Start Menu, go to Control Panel and click Uninstall a program.</p>
<p>- Next, click Turn Windows features on or off. You'll probably want to expand the window that opens.</p>
<br/>

<p>- In Windows Features, enable Internet Information Services by clicking the box and then expand -> expand World Wide Web Services -> expand Application Development Features.</p>
<p>- Check the box next to CGI and click OK. Let the install do it's thing and click Finish once it completes. </p>
<p>- Jump over to the Browser and enter 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>- The default webpage will be showing now that we installed ISS. Without IIS enbled, if we went to 127.0.0.1, the "Hmmm... can't reach this page" message would appear. </p>

<p>- Now that we've got the web server going, its time to start installing evrything we need for osTicket. We'll start with PHP Manager for IIS. PHP is a backend web server language and osTicket basically runs on PHP. </p>
<p>- Open the osTicket-Installation-Files and install PHP Manager for IIS. (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0) </p>
<p>- Let the Installer do it's thing. Agree, click Next, and Yes on eveything.</p>
<p>- Next, install the Rewrite Module. (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi) Agree and click Next to everything.</p>

<p>- Create a directory on the C drive called PHP. </p>

<p>- Instead of just extracting right away, click Browse, navigate to Windows(C:), and select the new PHP folder we just created.</p>

<p>- Now, back to the osTicket Installation Files and install a couple more files.</p>
<p>- From osTicket-Installation-Files, install the VC Redistributable file (VC_redist.86). Click Yes and let it do it's thing.</p>
<p>- Next, we'll install MySQL 5.5.62. MySQL is a database that osTicket is going to use to store all of our data. The data will be all the user accounts, ticketing information, and everything we do in osTicket. This will all be stored in the database on the backend. </p>
<p>- Download (mysql-5.5.62-win32)</p>

<p>- Run the installer for MySQL. Choose "Typical" for Setup Type and click Next. See Figure 17 </p>

<p>- Select "Standard Configuration", and click Next. See Figure 19</p>

<p>- Okay, we've done a lot of jumping from folder to folder and changing windows to this point. Stand up, stretch, get something to drink, and maybe a snack so we can get locked in. This next step is beyond SUPER IMPORTANT! Absolutely DO NOT MESS THIS UP! (No Pressure) üòè</p>
<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Just type the word ROOT in both boxes. Yes, ROOT in all caps. ‚ö†Ô∏è </p>
<p>- Later on, the username will be root but the password is ROOT. This would be really bad in the real world but we're keeping simple for this project. A ton of people struggled with this part in the lab. The huge issue is we won't know its wrong until the end when osTicket fails to launch. </p>
<p>- Click Next, Execute on the next screen, and then Finish.</p>

<p>- Now that the scary part is over, we are going to Register PHP from within IIS. Open IIS as an Admin from the Start Menu.</p>
<p>- In IIS, open PHP Manager by double-clicking the icon.</p>

<p>- We need to reload IIS for the PHP registration to take effect.</p>
<p>- Right-click osTicket-vm in the top-left of IIS and select Stop. You should see a green animation slide across the top bar. </p>
<p>- Give it a couple seconds. Then, right-click osTicket-vm again and select Start. (You can use the Action buttons on the right side of IIS as well).</p>

<p>- Now run back to the osTicket Installation Files folder on the Desktop.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è We need to unzip (osTicket-v1.15.8.zip).</p>
<p>- Right-click osTicket-v1.15.8.zip and select Extract... </p>

<p>- There will be two folders inside. Scripts and Upload. </p>

<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Now, drag the "upload" folder from "osTicket-v1.15.8" folder and drop into the "wwwroot" folder. ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
<p>- DO NOT just copy and paste. I made this mistake during my first run through of the lab and osTicket failed to launch at the end.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò©  </p>
<p>- Confirm the "upload" folder actually moved from "osTicket-v1.15.8" and into "wwwroot". See Figure 33</p>

<img width="600" alt="OT35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e44f2551-3c10-47ce-88de-7efc70d636ee" />

<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Within "wwwroot", rename "upload" to "osTicket" exactly like in Figure 34. ‚ö†Ô∏è </p>
<p>- This is another area where people stuggled during the lab. So double check before moving on. </p>
<p>- Next, we'll need to reload IIS again. (Stop, Start the web server) From the Start Menu, run IIS as an Admin. Right-click osTicket-vm and click Stop. Wait a couple seconds, then right-click osTicket-vm and click Start. Refer back to Figure 26 and Figure 27 if needed.</p>

<p>- In IIS on the left side of the screen, under Connections, go in this order:</p> 
 <p> osTicket-vm -> Sites -> Default Web Site -> osticket. (See Figure 35) /p>
<p>- Then on the left side, under Browse Folder, click Browse *:80 (http).</p>
<p>- Well looky there! We did it! Trust me when I say this is a GREAT sign. This means that we've done evrything correct up to this point.üéâ </p>
<p>- Alright, settle down because there's still work to be done. We need to grab some missing extensions before we can party. See Figure 36</p>

<p>- There's just something about riding off into the sunset. Lets take a moment to reflect upon the journey we just embarked.</p>

<h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes our project. We successfully installed osTicket on our Windows virtual machine! Most companies use some form of a ticketing system in their every day operations. This project gave me the opportunity to experince a sample of what all is required to simply load a web page you might use at work. We'll dive into osTicket and do some post-install configurations in the next project. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one! üòé
