</p>
<p>
 - In Azure, create a virtual machine named osTicket-vm. Refer back to this previous project if needed:[Creating Virtual Machines in the Cloud](https://github.com/ajowyit/creating-virtual-machines). Use the same configurations.
</p>
<p>
 - Log into it.
</p>
<p>
 - Open a browser like Microsoft Edge and paste this link to download the .zip file for the osTicket installation files into the browser and press Enter: [osTicket Installation Files](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1b3RBkXTLNGXbibeMuAynkfzdBC1NnqaD&export=download&authuser=0) 
</p>
<p>
 Click "Download anyway"

<p>
 - Right-click the folder. Click "Extract All..."
</p>
<p>
 - Confirm the correct destination (C:\Users\{username}\Desktop\osTicket-Installation-Files). Click Extract. Make sure the folder is called "osTicket-Installation-Files"</p>
<p>
 - After the folder is finished extracting all the files, you may have to minimize your windows to see it, but there should be an icon for the folder of the actual osTicket installation files on the browser.
</p>
<p>
 - We will use the files in this folder to install osTicket. You can delete the .zip file now it is no longer needed.

<p>
 - Next we will enable IIS (Internet Information Services) within Windows WITH CGI as well.
</p>
<p>
 - From the Start Menu, open up Control Panel. Under Programs, click "Uninstall a program". This should get you to the "Uninstall or change a program" window. 
</p>
<p>
 - On the left side, click "Turn Windows features on or off". A window will open where we can turn Windows features on or off. It is recommended to expand the window so you can see more.

</p>


<p>
 - In the Windows Features window, enable Internet Information Services by clicking the box. Then expand it. Then expand World Wide Web Services. Then expand Application Development Features.
</p>
<p>
 - Check the box next to CGI and click OK. Let the install do it's thing and click Finish once it completes. A window may pop up saying that Windows needs to reboot your PC to finish installing the requested changes. Click "Restart Now" to finish installation.
</p>
<p>
 - After restarting, go to the Browser and enter 127.0.0.1(the loopback address).
</p>
<p>
 - The default page will be show that we installed ISS. Without IIS enbled, if we went to 127.0.0.1, the "Hmmm... can't reach this page" message would appear instead. Make sure we are on the Internet Innformation Services Page.

</p>
<p>
 - Now, its time to start installing evrything we need for osTicket. We'll start with PHP Manager for IIS. PHP is a backend web server language. OsTicket basically runs on PHP. 
</p>
<p>
 - Open up osTicket installation files folder from the desktop and install PHP Manager for IIS. Double click PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0. 
</p>
<p>
 - When the installer window pops up, click "Next", select "I Agree", click "Next", and click "Close" when finished
</p>

 - Next we want to create a directory on the C drive called PHP. 
</p>
<p>
 - Open up File Explorer, then vavigate to Windows(C:) and create a new folder named "PHP".

<br/>

<p>
 - Next we want to extract the PHP files from the osTicket-Installation-Files into the newly created PHP folder in the C drive.

<p>- Now, back to the osTicket Installation Files and install a couple more files.</p>
<p>- From osTicket-Installation-Files, install the VC Redistributable file (VC_redist.86). Click Yes and let it do it's thing.</p>
<p>- Next, we'll install MySQL 5.5.62. MySQL is a database that osTicket is going to use to store all of our data. The data will be all the user accounts, ticketing information, and everything we do in osTicket. This will all be stored in the database on the backend. </p>
<p>- Download (mysql-5.5.62-win32)</p>

<p>- Okay, we've done a lot of jumping from folder to folder and changing windows to this point. Stand up, stretch, get something to drink, and maybe a snack so we can get locked in. This next step is beyond SUPER IMPORTANT! Absolutely DO NOT MESS THIS UP! (No Pressure) üòè</p>
<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Just type the word ROOT in both boxes. Yes, ROOT in all caps. ‚ö†Ô∏è </p>
<p>- Later on, the username will be root but the password is ROOT. This would be really bad in the real world but we're keeping simple for this project. A ton of people struggled with this part in the lab. The huge issue is we won't know its wrong until the end when osTicket fails to launch. </p>
<p>- Click Next, Execute on the next screen, and then Finish.</p>

<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Now, drag the "upload" folder from "osTicket-v1.15.8" folder and drop into the "wwwroot" folder. ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
<p>- DO NOT just copy and paste. I made this mistake during my first run through of the lab and osTicket failed to launch at the end.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò©  </p>
<p>- Confirm the "upload" folder actually moved from "osTicket-v1.15.8" and into "wwwroot". See Figure 33</p>

<img width="600" alt="OT35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e44f2551-3c10-47ce-88de-7efc70d636ee" />

<p>- ‚ö†Ô∏è Within "wwwroot", rename "upload" to "osTicket" exactly like in Figure 34. ‚ö†Ô∏è </p>
<p>- This is another area where people stuggled during the lab. So double check before moving on. </p>
<p>- Next, we'll need to reload IIS again. (Stop, Start the web server) From the Start Menu, run IIS as an Admin. Right-click osTicket-vm and click Stop. Wait a couple seconds, then right-click osTicket-vm and click Start. Refer back to Figure 26 and Figure 27 if needed.</p>

<p>- Since we're already in IIS. Lets check our work and attempt to load the osTicket site..</p>
<p>- In IIS on the left side of the screen, under Connections, go in this order:</p> 
 <p> osTicket-vm -> Sites -> Default Web Site -> osticket. (See Figure 35) /p>
<p>- Then on the left side, under Browse Folder, click Browse *:80 (http).</p>
<p>- Well looky there! We did it! Trust me when I say this is a GREAT sign. This means that we've done evrything correct up to this point.üéâ </p>
<p>- Alright, settle down because there's still work to be done. We need to grab some missing extensions before we can party. See Figure 36</p>

<p>- There's just something about riding off into the sunset. Lets take a moment to reflect upon the journey we just embarked.</p>
<br/>

<h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes our project. We successfully installed osTicket on our Windows virtual machine! Most companies use some form of a ticketing system in their every day operations. This project gave me the opportunity to experince a sample of what all is required to simply load a web page you might use at work. We'll dive into osTicket and do some post-install configurations in the next project. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one! üòé
